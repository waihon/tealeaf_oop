# Benefits of Object Oriented Programming

# Waihon's answers
# 1. Encapsulation of attributes and functions in the same class
# 2. Reuse of superclass' methods through inheritance
# 3. Customization through subclasses

# Tealeaf's answers
# 1. Creating objects allow programmers to think more abstractly about 
#    the code they are creating.
# 2. Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to comceptualize.
# 3. It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that
#    need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
# 4. It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an 
#    application without duplication.
# 5. We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
# 6. As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more
#    easily managed.
